# Food Ordering Pattern Analysis

This project analyzes food ordering patterns across different cities and food categories. The goal is to identify key trends and insights that can inform business strategies for food delivery services.

## Project Description

In this project, we used data analysis and visualization techniques to explore food ordering behaviors. We focused on major cities and popular food categories to draw meaningful conclusions about customer preferences and market demands.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.

## Data

The data used in this project includes information on food orders, including:

- City of the customer
- Food category ordered
- Order frequency

## Analysis

Our analysis focused on:

1. **Order Volume by City**: We identified the cities with the highest number of food orders. Major metropolitan areas such as Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Chennai emerged as the top cities with the most orders.
2. **Popular Food Categories**: We analyzed the frequency of different food categories being ordered. Indian, South Indian, Chinese, and North Indian cuisines were the most popular among customers.

## Conclusion

- **High Order Volume in Major Cities**: A significant portion of the food orders comes from major metropolitan areas such as Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Chennai. These cities show a high demand for food delivery services, indicating a robust market presence in these regions.
- **Popular Food Categories**: The most frequently ordered food categories are Indian, South Indian, Chinese, and North Indian cuisines. These categories dominate the food delivery market, highlighting a strong preference among customers for these types of food.

## Visualization

We created various visualizations to support our analysis, including bar charts and pie charts to represent the distribution of orders by city and food category.
